    <p class="about-font">
        Stories are important aren't they. I bet often times you must have found yourself wondering that your own life kind of life a story.
        To be precise. Life is a perfect story. Andd.... if you haven't ever thought like this then mate you need to 
        see around a little more clearly.

        Often times we are lost in the multitude of all that is going on around. People seem to have figured out what they want with life (realllyyy....how man ??) and you still seem to struggle with all that
        you want to do. Because there's so much to do, so much to change and so much to be experienced. But fear not my friend, thy is not alone. In moments like this, a good l book takes you hand and 
        brings you out of that clutching darkness of, of...well life.
